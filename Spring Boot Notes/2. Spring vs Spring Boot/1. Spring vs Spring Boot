Both Framework are used to build Rest APIs.

Spring Boot is made on top of Spring.

Spring is highly configurable but due to this it takes effort as well.

Spring has mainly 3 layers:

1. Presentation
2. Service
3. Persistance

More about Persistance:

It is where we handle interaction with Database. Here we talk about Entities and DAO/Repositories

More about Services:

Goal of this Layer is to use all the functionality exposed by Persistance layer to meet the requirement for which the app is being built to handle.


More about Presentation:
Goal of this Layer is to use all the data from Services Layer and expose it to User.
