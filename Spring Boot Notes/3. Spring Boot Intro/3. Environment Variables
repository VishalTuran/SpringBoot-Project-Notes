We can also use Environment Variable to pass some important config for our app.

The General Syntax of Environment Variable is very similar to config file.

Ex:

server.port --> SERVER_PORT

Words are CAPTITALISED and delimitter is replaced with UnderScore

Passing the environment variables:

1. RUN COMMAND: "SERVER_PORT=9291 ./mvnw spring-boot:run"

or

1. RUN COMMAND: "export SERVER_PORT=9291"
2. RUN COMMAND: "./mvnw spring-boot:run"
