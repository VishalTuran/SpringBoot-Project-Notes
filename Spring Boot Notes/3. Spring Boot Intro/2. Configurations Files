Configurations files are used to add Config aboout the project.

We can add all the config in application.properties. This file accepts key-value pair.

Ex:

server.port=8081

This is used to define the port where our application will run

All the key are well documented in Spring Boot Docs.

It's not neccessary to use properties file, we can use yaml, json etc.
