@SpringBootApplication annotation is used to specify that we are working with Spring Boot.

Not just this, it does a lot of work under the hood.

This Annotation does mainly work for 3 three other Spring Annotation
1. @Configuration - This is used to Specify the Configuration where all the Beans are defined.
2. @ComponentScan - This is used to Specify the starting point from which the Spring will start looking for Beans(Class annotated with @Component)
3. @EnableAutoConfiguration
